- Fixed a bug in generated code that caused variable-
  length bit arrays to be serialized incorrectly (missing the length field)

### Changed

- Improved documentation of generated fields

## [canadensis_codegen_rust-v0.3.1](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/tree/canadensis_codegen_rust-v0.3.1) - 2022-07-14

### Added

- The compile process now reports warnings when it detects names using
  non-standard case conventions
- Generated types are marked as deprecated if the
  corresponding DSDL types are deprecated

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused generated code to not
  serialize the length field of a variable-length array of bits

- Support the new `.dsdl` extension for cyphal data types [#12](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/pull/12)
- Report warnings for type and field names that do
  not follow the DSDL case conventions

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused service responses to
  not be marked as deprecated
- Added a check that prohibits using a deprecated
  type in a non-deprecated type (the specification requires this check)

### Changed

- The public regulated data types in `canadensis_dsdl_frontend` are now a submodule. This should not
  impact any downstream code, but `git clone --recursive` is now required to make all the tests pass.
  [#13](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/pull/13)
- Improved performance by adding a special case for BitLengthSet % integer

### Added

- Implemented `RegisterType` for bool values [#7](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/pull/7)

### Changed

- Renamed most instances of UAVCAN in the documentation to Cyphal, following the [renaming](https://forum.opencyphal.org/t/uavcan-v1-is-now-cyphal/1622)

### Added

- Added documentation of some values that must be powers of two

### Fixed

- Fixed examples to work with heapless 0.7.9

## [canadensis_write_crc-v0.1.1](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/tree/canadensis_write_crc-v0.1.1) - 2022-01-02

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect CRC calculation in canadensis_write_crc

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/tree/v0.2.1) - 2021-11-06

This release applies only to the crates `canadensis_core`, `canadensis`, `canadensis_dsdl_parser`, `canadensis_dsdl_frontend`, `canadensis_codegen_rust`, `canadensis_macro`, and `canadensis_bit_length_set`

### Added

- Added missing repository to the Cargo.toml files of `canadensis_dsdl_parser`, `canadensis_dsdl_frontend`, `canadensis_codegen_rust`, `canadensis_macro`, and `canadensis_bit_length_set`
- Added `Display` implementation for `SubjectId`
- Added some `Debug` implementations

### Fixed

- Various index maps using `TrivialHasher` produced incorrect results.
  These bugs were fixed by replacing it with the default `FnvHasher`.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/tree/v0.2.0) - 2021-10-31

This section is not complete because version 0.2.0 had too many changes.

### Added

- Experimental UAVCAN/UDP transport
- Experimental UAVCAN/Serial transport
- Transport abstraction (a node can now use any type of transport)
- DSDL parser, frontend, and Rust code generator
- Procedural macro that generates Rust code from inline or external DSDL

### Changed

- The `canadensis` library no longer re-exports anything from `canadensis_can`. Applications need to depend on
  additional libraries for the transports they use.
- Node types moved from `canadensis_node` to `canadensis`
- Node ID and transfer ID types removed from `canadensis_core` because they were CAN-specific (each transport now has
  its own versions of these types)
- Many other changes

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/samcrow/canadensis/tree/v0.1.0) - 2021-07-11

Initial release
